# Assignment two checklist
- [ ] Density Plot showing variation in each gene's expression & Names converted to HUGO
- [ ] PCA, UMAP and t-SNE plots colored by group
- [ ] Differential Expression
      Table of statistically significant differentially expression genes including method-dependent relevant info (p-value, log fold change, etc) in GitHub repository. Above, but only showing the top 50 genes and included in the assignment writeup. Volcano plot showing fold change and significance. Includes both up- and down-regulated genes
- [ ] Heatmap showing differentially expressed genes
- [ ] 1 method/ontology pair per student
	 table for each method/ontology pair with enriched terms (GO, msigDB, etc) one table of combined results, top 10 terms that are enriched in all methods.
- [ ] Assignment write up
       3-5 sentences summary of each table/plot created for the assignment. Table of top 20 overlapping terms from enrichment analysis, etc.
- [ ] Github Code: all assignment code added to Github with appropriate comments
- [ ] Full results for each analysis are included in a results folder in the GitHub repository.
