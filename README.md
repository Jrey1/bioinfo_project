# Bioinformatics Research Topic: Interferon-β and Gene Regulation in MS

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of RNA sequence data. The data utilized for this analysis has been sourced from the experiment titled "Interferon-β corrects massive gene dysregulation in multiple sclerosis: Short-term and long-term effects on immune regulation and neuroprotection," available on refine.bio.

### Scientific Question

The central scientific question of this project is: **"Of genes that are expressed differently between MS subjects and healthy controls, does IFN-beta treatment cause gene expression to align more closely with healthy controls?"**

## Data Description
The dataset used can be found at: 
https://www.refine.bio/experiments/GSE138064/interferon-corrects-massive-gene-dysregulation-in-multiple-sclerosis-short-term-and-long-term-effects-on-immune-regulation-and-neuroprotection

It includes RNA-seq data taken from mononuclear cells from subjects injected with IFN-β, a cytokine, four days prior. The experiment groups are: IFN-β-treated MS Complete Responders (CR) stable for five years, stable and active Partial Responders (PR), stable and active untreated MS, and healthy controls.
