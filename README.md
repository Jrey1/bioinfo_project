# Comprehensive Analysis of TCR's Repertoire in Patients with Neurological Immune-Mediated Disorders

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire in patients with neurological immune-mediated disorders. The data utilized for this analysis has been sourced from the experiment titled "Comprehensive Analysis of TCR's Repertoire in Patients with Neurological Immune-Mediated Disorders" (SRP164913), available on refine.bio.

### Scientific Question

The central scientific question of this project is: **"How does the T-cell receptor repertoire vary in patients with different neurological immune-mediated disorders?"**

This analysis aims to identify potential correlations between the diversity and clonality of TCRs and the specific neurological conditions under investigation. The results may provide insights into the immune mechanisms underlying these disorders and could inform the development of targeted therapies or diagnostic tools.

## Data Description

### Source
The data for this project was sourced from refine.bio, specifically from the experiment SRP164913. The dataset includes TCR sequencing data from patients diagnosed with various neurological immune-mediated disorders.

### Data Type
- **TCR Sequencing Data:** This includes information about the diversity and clonality of T-cell receptors in the patients' immune cells.
- **Metadata:** Associated metadata includes patient demographic information, disease type, and other relevant clinical information.

### Data Usage
The data will be used to:
- Analyze the diversity of TCR repertoires in different patient groups.
- Investigate potential associations between TCR diversity/clonality and specific neurological disorders.
- Identify common or unique TCR sequences that may be associated with disease states.

## Methodology

The project will employ various bioinformatics tools and statistical methods to analyze the TCR sequencing data. Key steps will include:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Quality control and normalization of sequencing data.
- **Diversity Analysis:** Calculation of diversity metrics (e.g., Shannon diversity index) to compare TCR diversity across patient groups.
- **Clonality Analysis:** Assessment of TCR clonality to identify dominant clones and their potential disease associations.
- **Statistical Testing:** Application of statistical tests to determine the significance of observed differences between groups.

## Expected Outcomes

The outcomes of this project may include:
- A comprehensive profile of TCR diversity and clonality in patients with neurological immune-mediated disorders.
- Identification of specific TCR sequences or patterns associated with certain diseases.
- Insights into the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders.
