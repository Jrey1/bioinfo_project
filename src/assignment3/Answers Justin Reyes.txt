Justin Reyes --- Guassian Mixture Model

2. Indivdual Tests
	a) N/A
	b) Chosen method is Gaussian mixture models (ii). This will be represented
		by "gmm" in file names.
	c) N/A
	d) My method found 8 clusters.
		i) N/A
		ii) I chose my k value using Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).
			It automatically returns the best k value, so no testing was needed.
			Using different k values only changes how tight the cluster groupings
			are, either larger or smaller based on smaller/lower k values.
	e)
		i) Changing the number of genes changed the visual layout of the plot as
			well as the optimal k value.
		ii) Chi-square tests table in src/assignment3/gmm_chi_square_results.xlsx
