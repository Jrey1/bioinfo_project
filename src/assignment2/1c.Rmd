Load the HUGO mapped data.
```{r}
df <- read.delim("../../data/SRP164913/SRP164913_HUGO.tsv",header = TRUE, row.names = 1, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
cat("Number of Genes in the expression matrix: ", dim(df)[1], "\n")
cat("Number of Samples in the expression matrix: ", dim(df)[2], "\n")
```

# Density Plot of Gene Expressions

```{R}
# Log scale the data, +1 to prevent undefined values for 0.
head(df)
log_df <- log2(df+1)
head(log_df)
# Get the median of expressions by gene
gene_median <- apply(log_df, 1, median)
cat("Variance between gene expression medians:", var(gene_median))
# Create a Data frame from the numerical array
gene_median_df <- data.frame(Median = gene_median)
# Plot the values
ggplot(gene_median_df, aes(x = Median)) + geom_density() + ylim(0,0.01) + xlab("Gene Expression Count")
```
The density plot shows a Righ Skewed distribution of gene Expression counts with most of the expressions being between zero and fifty but with a few outliers around 90, 120 and 200 expressions.
